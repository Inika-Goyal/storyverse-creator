# This is StoryVerse✒️

## Project info

  Episode-based planning: Visual dashboards let creators track the progress of each piece of content.

  AI assistance: Automatically generate scripts, suggest hooks, and discover trending topics in your niche.

  Performance insights: See the best time to post and track how each episode performs.

  Collaboration: Connect with editors, designers, or other creators in the Creator Lounge for feedback and partnership.
